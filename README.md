# Machine-Learning-Labs

Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience. This course covers the practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives.


## Description of labs :

1. `Numpy and Pandas:` To understand Numpy and Pandas libraries in depth and implement the Basic functions using these libraries.

2. `Search Algorithms:` Write two functions A* Traversal and DFS Traversal which implements the respective algorithm.

3. `Decision Tree Classifier:` Decision Tree is to create a training model that can be used to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data.

4. `K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN):` Prepare a Python class KNN which can be used for classification.

5. `Backpropogation [ANN]:` Implement "chain rule" using computation graphs. Compute the gradient of a Tensor variable with respect to the leaf nodes of the computation graph that created the Tensor.

6. `Support Vector Machines:` Implement a Support Vector Machine classifier using the scikit-learn machine learning framework. Create a pipeline using the pre-processing steps and the SVM classifier to automate the entire process of training and evaluating the model you build.

7. `Adaboost:` An ensemble method is a technique that combines the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms together. To make more accurate predictions than any individual model.

8. ` Hidden Markov Model(HMM):` Implement the Viterbi algorithm for decoding a sequence of observations to find the most probable sequence
of internal states that generated the observations.

9. `K-Means Clustering:` Code for the class K-Means Clustering which will implement K-Means Algorithm.

## File structure documentation :

#### There are total 9 MI Weeks and Coding Assignments  

Each week folder has 3 comman file :
  * Week Manual.pdf - This document includes a detail explanation of each task and function block. 
  * File_Name.py - The implementation of the actual code block and function is contained in this document.
  * SampleTest.py - This document offers test cases to help you validate your code.  
> **NOTE :** These sample test cases are just for your reference only.

Additional files in some week directories include `report` and `dataset` in .csv format

## How to run :

#### For Windows Systems
```bash
  python SampleTest.py --SRN File_Name
```
* Example : python SampleTest.py --SRN Nump_Pandas

#### For Linux Systems  
```bash
  python3 SampleTest.py --SRN File_Name
```  
* Incase of any import error use the below command
```bash  
  python3.7 SampleTest.py --SRN File_Name
```

## Library Installation

In case of missing library errors install packages via pip package manager or any other package manager of your choice. 

```bash
  pip install <library_name>
```
